# Project 1: Navigation

### Introduction
This is the final project of the section 'Value-Based Methods' of the Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning 
nanodegree .
In this project, we need to train an agent to navigate (and collect bananas!) in a large, square world.  

![Trained Agent][image1]

A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana.  Thus, the goal of your agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.  

The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around agent's forward direction.  Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions.  Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:
- **`0`** - move forward.
- **`1`** - move backward.
- **`2`** - turn left.
- **`3`** - turn right.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.

### Project description

The sample Deep Q-Network solution for 'LunarLander-v2' was used as a starting point for this
project. This sample solution, as-is, does allow to train the agent and obtain decent performance.
In fact, the agent can get to an average reward of about 11 at around the 900th episode (rolling 
average of latest 100 episodes.)

From that starting point, the following improvements were added:
1. Using Double DQN when evaluating Q-values (method 'q_targets' of class Agent.)
2. Implemented Prioritized Experience Replay (using
   implementation from https://github.com/rlcode/per)
3. Change the model architeture to Dueling DQN (model.py)

From these improvements, the agent converges to that same average reward to 11 in less than
400 episodes.

### Trained agent

To use the trained agent, simply import weights:
```
from dqn_agent import Agent
agent = Agent()
agent.save('./model_weights')
```

### Development environment

1. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:
    - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux.zip)
    - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana.app.zip)
    - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86.zip)
    - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86_64.zip)
    
    (_For Windows users_) Check out [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64) if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

    (_For AWS_) If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not [enabled a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md)), then please use [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux_NoVis.zip) to obtain the environment.

2. Place the file in the DRLND GitHub repository, in the `p1_navigation/` folder, and unzip (or decompress) the file. 

### Training the agent

Follow the instructions in `Navigation.ipynb` or execute train.py to train the agent.
